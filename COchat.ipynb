        "*   The chatbot successfully integrated a `distilgpt2` LLM to handle questions not found in the FAQs.\n",
        "*   A guardrail was implemented to filter LLM responses containing sensitive keywords using `contains_sensitive_keywords`.\n",
        "*   A relevance guardrail was added to check if LLM responses contained banking-related keywords; this guardrail was found to be overly strict, filtering out many potentially relevant LLM responses.\n",

        "*   Known FAQ queries were answered correctly without triggering the fallback, LLM, or logging.\n",
        "*   Non-banking questions were successfully filtered by the irrelevance guardrail or triggered the standard fallback message.\n",

        "\n",
        "While the current semantic similarity check using cosine similarity provides a basic relevance guardrail, more sophisticated methods could be explored in future iterations to improve the accuracy and flexibility of filtering LLM responses, especially for nuanced queries or to better handle responses that are partially relevant or contain hallucinated information. Potential alternatives include:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Using a Different Embedding Model:** Experiment with larger or domain-specific sentence embedding models that might capture semantic similarity more accurately for banking and related topics.\n",
        "*   **Training a Relevance Classifier:** Collect a dataset of query-response pairs and label them as \"relevant\" or \"irrelevant\". Train a classification model (e.g., a simple logistic regression, a more complex neural network) on this labeled data to predict the relevance of new LLM responses.\n",
        "*   **Prompting the LLM for Self-Evaluation:** For more capable LLMs (like Gemini), the prompt could be designed to include instructions for the LLM to evaluate its *own* response for relevance to the original query before providing the final output.\n",
        "*   **Combining Multiple Metrics:** Instead of relying solely on cosine similarity, combine it with other metrics or heuristics, such as keyword overlap, entity matching, or checking for the presence of specific topics.\n",
        "*   **Threshold Tuning per Query Type:** Potentially use different relevance thresholds based on the detected category of the user query (e.g., a slightly lower threshold for banking-related queries than for general knowledge questions).\n",
